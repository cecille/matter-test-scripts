# Common test failures

The documents in this folder are intended to be used to help root-cause common test failures, especially in cases where the underlying cause of the failure may not be immediately obvious from the test step or expected outcomes.

The test cases listed in these files are not an exhaustive list and this folder is intended to act as a growing repository.
